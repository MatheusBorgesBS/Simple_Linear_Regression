Linear Regression for Salary Prediction

This repository implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict salary based on years of experience. The dataset contains two variables:

    YearsExperience (X-axis): The number of years of work experience.

    Salary (Y-axis): The annual salary in USD.

The goal is to build a model that can predict the salary based on the number of years of experience using linear regression.
