# ðŸ“ˆ Simple Linear Regression - Salary vs Experience

This repository contains a basic **Simple Linear Regression** project using Python, applied to the relationship between **years of experience** and **salary**. The goal is to predict salaries based on experience using a linear model, with visualizations and evaluation plots.

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Š What the project does
- Loads a dataset with `YearsExperience` and `Salary` columns
- Splits the data into training and test sets
- Trains a simple linear regression model
- Displays:
  - The equation of the fitted regression line
  - A scatter plot with the regression line
  - A `y_test` vs `y_pred` plot with the identity line `y = x` for reference

## ðŸ“Ž Example plot
